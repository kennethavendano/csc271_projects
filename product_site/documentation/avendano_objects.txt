For my product site I will use a fantasyplayer object to represent each player in a user's fantasy football lineup on the players page. Each object stores the players position, name, last game points, risk level and the id of the table cell where the start/sit recommendations will appear. There will also be functions to get the risk level and calculate if the player should start or sit them.
