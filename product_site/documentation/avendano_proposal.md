# Part II: Finding Your Product 

You will be thinking of a product that can be turned into a website. A “product” could be to make money, but it also could be to help people or help an existing organization. If you are still looking for an idea, here are some other ways that you can generate ideas:

- Find your motivation. If you are building a product because you think it is revolutionary, but have zero interest in using the product yourself, you will probably get tired and stop development. Make a product that you are passionate about and that is relevant to your own interests to ensure that you will stay interested throughout the development process.
Keep it simple. It is tempting to create a product that does all the things. Don’t. All you will accomplish is creating a product that overwhelms and drives away users.

- Don’t worry if your idea exists already. There are millions of websites and apps out there. The chances of creating a totally novel idea are incredibly slim. Even if a similar product exists, any idea can be improved upon. Plus, existing products in the genre just means there is a market! If you develop an idea that has no competitors, chances are, there is no one that wants it.

- Browse the top 100 apps in the App Store or Google Play Store, and write down any ideas you have as a result. You can also look at the best and worst user reviews to get a sense for what users are saying.
