# Modularizing Your Scripts
## A. My website contains some logic that could be repeated like fetching and displaying player data and calculating fantasy points.
## B. I could create a function that fetches API data for a selected team and a compute fantasy points function
## C. getPlayerData(team) would retreive a players data from the API it would require the players name and return JSON file containing there stats. Another function would be to generate fantasy projections from there stats. It would require there stats and return there fantasy points score.
