On my website, I added an interactive event where a football image can be dragged around the page. The selected element is a football graphic placed on the main interface. The event that triggers the response is a set of mouse events that control dragging. When the user clicks the football, the page records the click position. When the user moves the mouse, the football follows the movement and updates its position. When the user releases the mouse button, the dragging stops. This behavior gives the page a simple interactive feature that makes the layout feel more playful and responsive without affecting the main content.
